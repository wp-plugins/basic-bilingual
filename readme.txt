== Description ==

Allows you to set the language of individual posts and pages and to summarize
them in other languages.

The excerpts are automatically inserted right before the post content, with the
correct language attribute. The correct language attribute is also set on the
post titles and original content.

If you were using this plugin prior to version 1.0 you will have to migrate
your posts and pages.

1. Make sure your back-up your database
1. Select the same 2 languages you were previously using in the "Site languages"
option
1. Press the "Migrate" button on the settings page

You might want to check [my work on multilingualism online](http://climbtothestars.org/focus/multilingual)
to understand what brought me to develop this plugin.

We also welcome volunteers to translate that plugin into more languages. If you
wish to help then contact [@stephtara](https://twitter.com/stephtara) on Twitter
or see [Stephanie's contact page](http://climbtothestars.org/contact/).


== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the plugin translate my posts? =

No. Basic Bilingual gives you the possibility to write short summaries, or a
complete translation of your posts and pages, in other languages.

= Does it work with more than two languages? =

Yes, since version 1.0!

= Aren't there more complete plugins out there if I want to make all my content available in more than one language? =

Yes, there certainly are. My approach is to keep it simple and minimal, so that
it works. I've been blogging bilingually since 2000, using
[the method this plugin reproduces](http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2004/07/11/multilingual-weblog/)
since 2004.

Translating everything is just too hard. Giving a brief summary allows people
who don't understand the language you're writing the post well enough to at
least know what it's about.
See [my work on multilingualism online](http://climbtothestars.org/focus/multilingual)
for more explanations.

= Some of my excerpts are disappearing, help! =

This is a problem up to version 0.3, sorry.
See [Mark's explanation](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/01/28/authorization-and-intentionorigination-verification-when-using-the-edit_post-hook/)
and download 0.31, which should work.

= Is the plugin working with cache plugins? =

Yes, unless you are using the "Use Language-Accept header" option. In that case
you'll need to use the template tags and enclose them between `mfunc` tags
(see you cache plugin's documentation about how to use those tags).
